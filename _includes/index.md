## The short version

I'm a software developer originally from Melbourne, Australia. I've worked and lived all over the place, but am currently set up in the Bay Area.

I co-founded [Geddit](http://letsgeddit.com), as its CTO. We graduated from the 2013 cohort of Imagine K12, the SV education-tech accelerator founded by Tim Brady & Geoff Ralston. 
Before that I worked for [PlayUp](http://playup.com/) as their Ruby Platform team lead, and [HannanIT](http://www.lambdasoftware.com.au/) as a ruby guy & contracting software swiss army knife.

In between I did a few fun things like [drive from London to Mongolia](http://dalyons.github.io/where-is-dave/?use_cached=true), & travel a good chunk of the world.

I also pretend to be handy with a camera, and occasionally I [write](http://loadedfingers.tumblr.com/).
